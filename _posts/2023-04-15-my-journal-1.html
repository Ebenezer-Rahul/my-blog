<p>I’m Vangur Ebenezer Rahul Deepak, and I’m starting this journal to make myself a little accountable for how I use my time. I want to become a great developer and learn interesting things in the field of Computer Science. I also want to read and watch great stories. I want to enjoy my time. And I get a lot of joy from being able to solve something. writing what I think are good programs. And testing my abilities to understand something great and learn how things work.</p><p>I want to start my Journal this May and record and try to explain things/concepts I come across as I believe in</p><blockquote>“if you can’t explain simply, you don’t understand it well enough.”</blockquote><p>As I think trying and making someone understand something, forces us to think why it(i.e something) makes sense. and you can’t fool yourself into believing that you understand something you don’t.</p><p>If it helps anybody, then I would be happy, even if not I think it would help me a lot.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=41c1344985d2" width="1" height="1" alt="">
